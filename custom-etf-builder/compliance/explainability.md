Principles
- LLM explains; engine decides. Weight calculations are deterministic and capped.
- Show the interpreted JSON back to the user for confirmation (future UI).
- Always list binding constraints and data timestamps.
- Prominent disclaimer:
  "This tool is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice."
